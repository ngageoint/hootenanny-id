      # Help

      This is a UI for [Hootenanny](https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny), the
      open-source, semi-automated conflation engine. The UI is based on [iD editor](http://ideditor.com/),
      a collaborative project with [source code available on GitHub](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD).
      iD Editor is the web platform for editing and contributing to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

    background: |
      # Background

      Hootenanny is designed to facilitate automated and semi-automated
      conflation of critical Foundation GEOINT features in the topographic domain,
      namely roads (polylines), buildings (polygons), and points-of-interest (POIs) (points).

      Hootenanny currently supports the conflation of POIs, Building polygons,
      Transportation polylines, and (experimentally) Waterway polylines.  When conflating
      these features, it is important to note that conflation occurs between similar feature types
      (e.g. POI to POI, Building to Building, Transportation polyline to Transportation polyline, etc.)
      but not across feature domains (POI to Polygon, POI to Polyline, etc.).

      Depending on the data and selected conflation options, the process of resolving
      ambiguous features is handled by an interactive conflict resolution workflow.
      Hootenanny cues up conflicts and drives the user to each conflict to make
      the appropriate geometry or attribute fix. Additionally, the user has the option
      to edit other features they may come across that need correcting while working
      through the conflict queue. There is also the option to accept all or discard
      all conflicts. This becomes a user choice and ultimately a risk assessment between
      accepting geometry and attribute errors resulting from automated algorithms versus
      the use purpose of the end product.

    adding_layers: |
      # Adding Layers

      During conflation, source datasets are merged based on user-specified
      conflation parameters to create an output layer that is ultimately superior
      in terms of complete geometry and attribution. Two datasets are required to
      perform a conflation: Reference and Secondary. To add a new Reference
      Dataset to the map, click on the Add Reference Dataset button on the left side.
      A list of available layers will appear in the drop down menu. In order to add a
      layer, it must be imported into Hootenanny through the Manage page.

      ### Zoom to Layer

      To zoom to the layer extent simply right-click on the layer and click on the
      Zoom to Layer button that appears on the layer name. This is useful when panning
      or zooming outside of the viewable extent or scale of the data.

    editing: |
      # Editing Features

      Users can select any point, line, or polygon feature and modify both the geometry
      and attribution displayed. Hootenanny provides the additional functionality of
      allowing users to toggle between different display tag schemas
      (OSM, TDS 6.1, and TDS 4.0) by changing the *Filter By Type* drop down to the
      desired tag format. This does not modify the underlying data but merely changes the displayed tag schema in the left panel.

      ## Modifying Layer Attributes
      When a feature has been selected (or a new one has been added), it is possible
      to modify both its geometry and the associated attribute values. First it’s
      important to note that each tag schema maintains it’s own set of default presets.
      If a type does not appear listed, type the name (e.g. Culvert) in the Search window
      that appears when you click on the icon. Values for each field can be edited by
      clicking in each attribute and either typing or selecting from a set of
      pre-populated values. Note that both OSM and TDS schemas will only support a set
      of limited values for certain fields so it’s best to consult domain subject
      matter experts when modifying.

      New fields can be added by clicking on the *Add Field* drop down menu and selecting
      an appropriate value. Additional tags can be added by clicking on the **+** button at
      the bottom of the *All tags* section. To delete or display additional info about a
      tag, click on either the trash can or info icons that appear next to each tag.
      Note that any changes will not be final to a layer until the user clicks on Save
      to commit the edits to the Hootenanny database. For OSM tags, users can check the
      *Sort A-Z* box to sort tags in alphabetical order.

      ## Modifying Layer Geometry
      To modify the feature geometry, click on the feature to expose the *editing palette*
      that pertains to the particular selected feature. Note that each unique geometry
      type and shape present their own options that may not display for other features.
      For instance, selecting a linear feature exposes editing options to straighten or
      change the directionality whereas clicking on a feature that traces a square,
      rectangle or circular path exposes options to make the feature a square or circle.
      Editing options include adding additional nodes by double clicking on a line segment,
      moving a node to manually modify the shape or path of a line or polygon, moving a point,
      and deleting features.

      ## Saving Edits
      In order to save any edits applied to a layer click on the Save button displayed on top
      in the map view or to revert to a previous edit. Save will commit any edits on a particular
      layer to the hoot database where as the Undo/Redo buttons will step back/forward through
      any modifications applied to either that layer’s geometry or attribution. The number displayed
      next to the Save button indicates the number of edits that will be committed to the database
      for a given session.

    adding_features: |
      # Adding New Features

      It is also possible to create new features for a given layer, but any new feature
      added must be done with at least one layer present. Any new features added without an
      associated layer cannot be saved.

      ### Adding a point feature

      To add a new point, click on the *Point* button appearing in the Map Viewer or use the 1 shortcut key.
      Points can be used to represent features such as shops, restaurants, parks and monuments, etc.
      They mark a specific location and describe the feature based on the OSM/TDS tag relationship.
      Once a new point is added to the map, a panel will appear on the map prompting you to select an
      appropriate feature type (park, cafe, etc) and any associated tags. Note that even though OSM
      values are presented, the data is stored on the database using the TDS tag equivalent.
      The next time it is edited within Hootenanny it will display the values using the english translated LTDS schema.

      ### Adding a linear feature

      To add a new linear feature, click on the *Line* button or use the 2 shortcut key and begin digitizing on the map.
      A pop-up message will appear if you would like to snap to an existing linear feature. Click on a single location
      to begin the linear feature and then continue clicking until feature has been completed. Double-click to complete
      the process and edit any attribution as needed. Repeat process for a new *Area* feature. Click *Save* to save all
      edits or step back/forward using the undo/redo buttons as needed.

    copying: |
      # Copying Features/Tags

      In certain circumstances it may be useful to utilize copy/paste functionality when editing layers and addressing
      conflict reviews within Hootenanny. For example, if users need to create multiple copies of a selected feature
      (or set of features) within the same map layer or they would like to copy attributes from a feature
      (or multiple selected features) in the reference layer to similar feature in the secondary layer when reviewing
      conflicts, they could use the following currently supported work flows.

      It is currently _not_ possible to copy/paste a feature from the Reference Dataset to the Secondary Dataset (or vice-versa)
      manually and if attempted the application will enter a idle state requiring refresh.

      ### Copying Features/Tags Within a Single Layer

      To copy a feature(s) within a single layer, select the feature or set of features that you wish to copy using the
      left-mouse button or by clicking on the red/blue conflict review table field. Note that you can select multiple
      features by pressing the shift key as you select each feature. When multiple features are selected they will appear
      listed on the left under the Selected items. Type *Ctrl + c* to copy the selected feature(s) and then *Ctrl + v* to
      display the copied feature(s) on the map. Once the copied feature(s) appear on the map they can be placed in the desired location.

      To copy tags within a single layer from one feature to another (or multiple selected features), select the feature
      to copy and type *Ctrl + c*, then select the target feature(s) to paste and use *Shift + Ctrl + v*. This will replace
      all of the selected feature tags (except name and those listed in the note below) with the copied source tags.

      ### Copying Tags Between Two Layers

      When reviewing  conflicts or editing features it is often useful to be able to copy tags from a selected feature and either
      append or overwrite the tags of another feature that can be within the same layer or in a different layer.  For example, when
      conflating two layers a selected set of features are flagged for the user to review and determine whether any further action is
      required. Users may decide that they need to copy a targeted set of tags from one feature to another.  The following workflow
      describes how that can be done.

      1. Select a feature and check the boxes next to each tag in the All Tags list that you wish to copy to the other feature.
      2. Select a different feature in the target layer and expand the All Tags list to display the existing tags.
      3. To append the copied tags, select the OSM POI (pink highlighted marker) and hit `Ctrl + Alt + v`.  Note that this action
      will produce a semicolon delimited list for any existing value e.g. name, source along with any new tags added from the source POI.
      To commit changes click the Save button or to undo click the undo button.
      4. To overwrite the copied tags in the target feature, select the OSM POI feature and `Ctrl + Shift + v`. Note that this action
      will overwrite any existing tag values.

    tools: |
      # Tools

      ## Hootenanny Map Tools
      Map navigation options appear in the upper right portion of the map viewer. To view a maptip and/or
      shortcut, hover the cursor over each button and information concerning the functionality of a particular feature will appear.

      ### Map Navigation

      Clicking on either **+** or **-** buttons will zoom the user one level higher/lower in the map. Alternatively users can use the middle scroll
      wheel of their mouse to zoom up or down levels. To open the map to your current location, click on the arrow button noting that
      some browser security settings do not allow users to share their location information.

      ### Background Settings

      Clicking on the *Background Settings* button opens up a panel displaying different background layer display
      options. To set the brightness for the background layer, click on the palette next to Background for 100%, 75%, 50%, or 25%
      brightness. Users can select from a range of publicly available basemaps such as Bing aerial imagery, MapQuest Open Aerial,
      Mapbox Satellite, OpenStreetMap, or create a custom basemap URL using the following URL template shown below. Any user
      uploaded Basemap images will appear in this panel. For those users with access to DigitalGlobe EV Web Hosting Service (EVWHS),
      the GBM/EGD imagery service can be selected using different imagery profiles e.g. Most Recent, Most Aesthetic Color, Least Cloud
      Cover. To get register for an account please visit: https://evwhs.digitalglobe.com/myDigitalGlobeAdmin/RegistrationRequest.html

      #### Image Carousel
      The image carousel displays all of the available images by timestamp and sensor that are in the DigitalGlobe GBM/EGD service if
      the service has been enabled. Users can select a particular DigitalGlobe image from the listed sensors/dates displayed in the carousel
      by clicking on the *Image Carousel* button or typing the *⌘I* shortcut key.

      ### Map Data

      The Map data settings allow users to add map overlay information such as a photo overlay from Mapillary or a local GPX file,
      modify the display settings for vector data, and filter existing Map Features. Mapillary is a crowd source platform that allows users
      to upload street level photos (not commonly used for conflation but part of the core OSM iD interface) when available. Users can
      also drag and drop a local GPX (GPS generated dataset) or use the file browser to add.

      Fill Areas allows users to select from three different options for displaying relevant vector data. The first option is *No Fill or
      Wireframe* which makes it easier to display background imagery. *Partial Fill* displays fill areas around their
      inner edges only. *Full Fill* displays features with complete fill turned. Users can adjust the *Line Width* by unchecking the use
       default value and setting the width value accordingly. Finally, users can filter Map Features of interest by simply
      checking or unchecking the boxes next to the common map features such as Points, Major Roads, Buildings, etc. To access the
      settings click on the *Map Data*.

      # Tools

      The Tools button provides users with a quick set of customized tools for measuring length/area and cropping layers to smaller
      subsets using either the visual extent or user defined bounding box. To access both options click on the Tools button and select
      either Measurement or Clip Tools.

      ### Measurement Tools

      There are two measurement tools currently provided; Measure linear distance or length of an object and measure the area of an
      object. To measure the length of an object on the map, click on the Tools button and select Measurement Tools | Measure Length.

      The cursor will then change into crosshairs indicating that you are able to measure a feature by drawing a line. To continue a drawing,
      left click to add nodes as needed. To complete the measurement double-click. To measure an area/perimeter of a feature, select the
      Measure Area option and click on the screen to add nodes and double click to complete the measurement. The measurement values
      will appear with the perimeter value listed above the area.  To clear the measurement vectors, click the Tools Menu button.


      ### Clip Tools

      The clip tools provide a simple mechanism for cropping map layers using either the current visual extent of the map or a user defined
      bounding box. An example use case might be if the user ingests a country level dataset into Hootenanny but is only interested in
      conflating a region or city within that data. Rather than conflate the entire country dataset, the user would clip the area using the
      Clip Tools to reduce it to a specific AOI and then run the conflation against that clipped dataset. The clip tool provides the option to 
      clip to visual extent, custom coordinates, or to a user-generated bounding box. If the preference is to define a bounding box on the map, 
      the user can select clip to bounding box and then single left-click on any location dragging the displayed box to the desired size and direction. 
      Keep in mind the first point clicked on the map is either the top or bottom corner depending on where the box is positioned.

      Once the coordinates are determined, a dialog box will pop up with options to specify an output name and path
      of the clipped dataset. After the job has successfully completed it will appear in the list of available datasets.

      # Conflation options

      ### Save As

      The name of the conflated data output that you would like to save. By default, a file name Merged_* is populated in this field but
      this can be overwritten manually by entering a specific layer name.

      ### Path

      The existing folder path where you want to save the conflated output. To create a new folder to save the output enter that in the New
      Folder Name field.

      ### New Folder Name

      The name of a new folder if you wish to create one to save the output. Note that it will be created at the level specified in the Path.
      Leave blank if no new folder is required.

      ### Type
      There are four types of conflation that are exposed in the UI: Reference, Average, Cookie Cutter & Horizontal and Advanced.  For more information
      on these conflation types, please consult the Hootenanny User Guides.

      ### Attribute Reference Layer
      During conflation, the attributes of reference data are used to update any secondary data. By default, the reference layer contains
      both the reference geometry and attribution. In many cases, however, reference geometry and attribution exists across multiple
      layers hence the need for conflation. To support this use case, select either the reference or secondary layer as the attribute reference
      layer.

      ### Collect Stats
      Hootenanny provides users with the ability to generate statistics and display information pertaining to each conflation and associated input
      layers. If false, Hootenanny will display only the conflation parameters i.e. the Reference/Secondary layer names and Conflation Type, and
      Options, i.e. what args were included in the conflation job, for the merged layer after the conflation job has completed. If true, Hootenanny
      will generate statistics such as the counts for all nodes, ways and relations in each of the input and output layers (similarly for counts of
        pois, roads, and buildings), counts of unmatched, merged, and review features as well as percentages for each.  These formatted statistics are
      displayed in the *Statistics* section of the layer info.  In addition, users can also view the raw statistics that Hootenanny collects when
      this option has been enabled.  These values appear as comma separated lists (e.g. Total Conflatable Features = 374,227,0) pertaining to the
      Reference Layer, Secondary Layer, and Merged Output Layer next to each statistic parameter.


    review: |
      # Reviewing Conflicts

      When conflating data it is inevitable that conflicts may arise due to the lack of a clear solution as a result of ambiguous relationships
      between matched features. When this occurs, reviewable items are flagged and presented to the user in the UI through an iterative
      review process where the user must decide a particular action (e.g. accept as resolved, modify or delete, or merge) before merging the
      final conflated output.

      During review, a single feature is compared with another (based on convergence of geometry and attribution) to determine whether
      a merge or alternative action is required. Note that feature merging is only available for POI to POI conflation. Otherwise the user
      can modify Features flagged for review will appear highlighted on the map in either red or blue corresponding to the Reference and
      Secondary input data. Clicking in any of the highlighted fields in the review table will select the feature in question and display
      its attribute in the left tag panel (see Figure 28). Users can toggle the review items table by clicking on the Hide/Show Table button
      located in the conflict review bar at the bottom. In order to complete the review process, all reviews must be resolved either by
      stepping through each individually or by clicking the Complete Review button to resolve remaining reviews and either export the
      data to the desired output format or add another layer for conflation.

      ### Review Text
      For more information on messages during reviews, please consult the Hootenanny User Interface Guide.

      ### Map-in-Map

      In Hootenanny, the concept of Map-in-Map is used here to describe an inset or overview map that contains additional spatial
      information relating to the conflation i.e where reviews occur within the AOI. When a conflation job completes and reviews are
      generated, users can display an overview map showing colored points representing the location (or centroid of the location) where
      unresolved, merged, and currently reviewed features occur for the corresponding AOI. To view this map, press the / key when
      reviewing features and the smaller overview map should display a set of points representing the review layer.

      Depending on the density of data flagged for review, the features are represented in the following manner: yellow dots corresponding
      to the location of unresolved reviews; a single red dot indicating the currently reviewed feature in the user’s session; and green dots
      representing any resolved or merged features. This visual aid becomes useful particularly when multiple users are editing the same
      layer simultaneously since it provides a map of the spatial distribution of reviews in real or near-real time.

      ### Multi-user Conflict Reviewing

      Hootenanny supports the notion of multi-user layer editing in the context of conflation reviews by adding business logic to the
      application that minimizes the likelihood that different users loading the same layer will be presented with the exact same review.
      Bear in mind that datasets containing fewer reviews (<50) will have a higher likelihood of two different users encountering the same
      conflict at the same time but given that most reviews require on average 15-20 seconds to resolve, the possible of simultaneous
      editing is relatively low. The ideal scenario for multi-user conflict reviewing is when a conflation job generates a large number
      of reviews in excess of several hundred or thousand where this work can be parsed out among users accessing the same layer to
      minimize down time when conflating data.

      ### Sharing Reviews
      To assist with the multi-user conflict reviewing, there is a new mechanism to allow users to better collaborate on reviews. When a
      user encounters a review that requires additional feedback prior to resolving, they can click the Share Review button.  This will pop-up
      a dialog box allowing them to enter some details about the review which others can then open separately as a bookmark from the Review
      Bookmarks in Manage.  A second user can then open the review bookmark, add additional comments and view that review to take any additional
      action required.

      # Manage Hootenanny

      The Manage capabilities within Hootenanny provide a set of administrative tools and data management options for users. This will
      provide a brief overview of the Manage Page for Hootenanny.  For more information, please consult the Hootenanny User Interface Guide.

      ### Translation Assistant

      The Translation Assistant was developed to facilitate the translation of "shoebox" (one-off or custom) datasets into Hootenanny’s
      internal format of OSM xml. Users must map attribute names and values from the source dataset to a common schema so that
      conflation operations can occur. The available target schemas in the current release include OSM and TDSv61. The choice of target
      schema is dependent on the users fluency with said schema and how conversant they will be in defining an accurate mapping, as
      well as technical factors noted below. All translations end up in the internal OSM schema when stored in the database and used
      during conflation operations.

      ### Translations

      The Translation settings page contains all of the predefined translations (MGCP, OSM, TDSv40, TDSv61) in addition to any custom
      translations that have been generated from the translation assistant. To add a new translation, click on the Add New Translation
      button. Populate the Name and Description fields in this form and copy/paste your Translation Assistant generated Javascript. Note
      that the translation assistant adds the translation file to the list of available translations as part of the custom translation workflow so
      users are not required to use the add new translation option and manually paste in their generated translation file. The pre-defined
      translations are displayed as read-only and cannot be edited by users however any custom translation will be editable by clicking on
      the folder icon and editing any Javascript as needed.

      ### Datasets

      The Datasets settings page provides users with options for managing data that they wish to use in Hootenanny including importing
      from source (shapefile, osm, geonames, FGDB), organizing data into a folder structure, renaming/deleting/moving data that has
      been already ingested, and exporting data from Hootenanny into pre-defined output formats and translation schemas.

      ### WFS Exports

      The WFS Export tab lists all of the available WFS Services that have been generated from previous conflation jobs. Click on the up
      arrow icon to display the WFS Resource URL. Copy/Paste the URL into a third party application that supports WFS. Note that the
      URL provided is the full GetCapabilities document describing the service.

      ### Manage Basemaps

      Hootenanny provides users with the capability to generate their own custom basemap service using a georeferenced image. Currently
      Hootenanny only supports GeoTIFF or png file types. To generate a new basemap that can be displayed in Hootenanny, click on the
      Basemap tab and the New Basemap button. Use the file browser to upload your local georeferenced image (GeoTIFF or png only).

      ### Log

      The Log tab provides both the Application and UI log for users to troubleshoot any issues that may occur during a user session.
      There are two panels that are provided here; The Error log which provides core and service logging detail (i.e. tomcat catalina.out)
      and the UI log which provides errors generated from the iD web client. The full log can be exported by clicking on the export
      full log button. Note that any UI issues will also appear on the map map in the upper right corner in red highlight when they are
      triggered. This messages are maintained in the UI log until the browser session is reloaded.

      ### Reports

      The Reports tab contains all of the generated reports for conflation jobs where Generate Report = True has been specified. To
      download a report, click on the arrow and save the file to your local desktop.

      ### Review Bookmarks
      The Review Bookmarks tab stores all of the shared reviews saved by various Hootenanny users.  Each bookmark can be edited to add any additional notes or comments. To
      view the bookmarked review in the map, click on the magnifying glass in the opened bookmark in the top right corner.  Once a review has been resolved the bookmark will
      remain with the status, RESOLVED, and the user will no longer be able to display the review.

      ### About Hootenanny
      This tab provides all of the version information for Hootenanny Core, Web Services and iD Editor versions and provides a link to download the Hootenanny User Interface Guide.
